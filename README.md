# Markdown-Blog

## Description

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax. Itâ€™s a great tool for the non-programming types and technical writers to write text without having to rely on HTML or those time-consuming WYSIWYG editors aka text editors. All the keyboard shortcuts of Markdown are much simpler to remember and become second nature once you practice them for a short time.

That's why I find it very useful to build out a complete blog with Markdown support that renders automatically HTML using **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Express**

## DevTools

I have used the following libraries :

- **jsdom** v16.2.1
- **marked** v0.8.0
- **mongoose** v5.9.4
- **slugify** v1.4.0
- **Bootstrap** v4.4.1
